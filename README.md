Base64 Encoding and Decoding in Python:

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates the process of encoding and decoding text and binary data using Base64.
Base64 is a common encoding scheme used to convert binary data into an ASCII string format. 
This is particularly useful when transmitting data over media that are designed to deal with text.

Getting Started:

Python 3.x installed on your machine.
Basic understanding of Python programming.


The script demonstrates how to:

Encode a simple text string to Base64.
Decode the Base64 string back to its original text.
Read an image file in binary mode, encode it in Base64, and then decode it back to its original binary form.


Explanation:

1. Text Encoding and Decoding:

The script starts by converting a simple string ("Hello world") into its ASCII byte form.
It then encodes the byte string into a Base64 format, which can safely be transmitted over text-based protocols.
Finally, it decodes the Base64 string back to its original form.


2. Binary Data Encoding and Decoding:

The script reads an image file (image_NueralNine.png) in binary mode.
It creates an identical copy of the image to demonstrate handling binary data.
The binary data is then encoded into a Base64 string, which is safe for text transmission.
The script also decodes the Base64 string back to its original binary data, showing that the process is reversible.

3. Use Cases
   
Transmitting Data: Base64 encoding is commonly used to safely transmit binary data like images, files, and executables over text-based protocols like email, HTTP, and others.
Storage: Sometimes, data is stored in Base64 format to ensure compatibility across systems that handle text rather than raw binary.
